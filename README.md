# the Crypto Quicktake chrome extension

## :tada: Introduction

- What is Crypto QuickTake?

  - The Crypto QuickTake is a chrome extension for cryptocurrency investors.
    - And it's read-only. Meaning that you can only read the price and the news of cryptocurrencies. And you can read your account information when you use an API key.

- Why is Crypto QuickTake read-only?

  - security
  - the whole idea of this project is to provide you a quick dashboard with the gist of the cryptocurrency market status.
  - It's never a full-featured application and never will be.

## :bangbang: About security

- The extension is **READ-ONLY** ! It always has been **READ-ONLY** and always will be.
- If you have a Binance account, the `API restrictions` in the `API management` section should check `can read` only !!
- I will never send you emails, text messages or anything unless you send me first. My email is eXVtaW5jb2luQGdtYWlsLmNvbQo=
